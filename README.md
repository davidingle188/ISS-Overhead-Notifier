# ISS-Overhead-Notifier
This Python script sends an email notification whenever the International Space Station (ISS) is overhead and it's nighttime at your location. It uses the ISS location API and the Sunrise-Sunset API to track the ISS position and determine whether it's dark outside. If both conditions are met, the script sends an email alert.
